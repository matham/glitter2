Zone channels code the position of static objects in the video. For example, it could code the position of
odors to be sniffed.

The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the area of the zone, or the duration the animal was in the zone, if coded.

Much of the channel management for zone channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

However, unlike event channels, zone channels are added by drawing them.
