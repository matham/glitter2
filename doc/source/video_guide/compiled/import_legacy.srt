Glitter supports importing legacy glitter files. These are files created by much
older versions of glitter that cannot be opened directly by the current version of glitter.

2
00:00:09,219  --> 00:00:10,855
From within the import section.

3
00:00:11,055  --> 00:00:14,467
First, select the legacy importing mode from the drop down menu.

4
00:00:15,179  --> 00:00:21,694
Then, select the output directory, where the glitter h 5 data files that are generated
from the legacy files, will be created.

5
00:00:22,380  --> 00:00:26,440
Next, select the input directory containing the legacy files to process.

6
00:00:27,140  --> 00:00:32,078
then, select the filter with which to select the legacy files in that directory and sub-directories.

7
00:00:32,278  --> 00:00:36,029
The shown filter will only select files that end with the h 5 extension.

8
00:00:36,740  --> 00:00:38,345
Finally, click refresh.

9
00:00:39,060  --> 00:00:44,387
Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.
