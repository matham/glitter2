Glitter lets you code behaviors, and lets you track the position of objects in a video file.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.901
To begin, browse for a video file with the browse button.

00:08.620 --> 00:10.136
and select a video file.

00:10.819 --> 00:12.894
This will open the video file in glitter.

00:17.100 --> 00:22.607
When data is coded with glitter, it stores the coded data, in a h 5 file right next to the video file.

00:23.300 --> 00:29.076
If the data file already exists, glitter will open the data file. Otherwise it will create a new data file.

00:29.276 --> 00:33.047
This data file is later used when computing and exporting statistics.

00:33.740 --> 00:41.491
Glitter also creates a temporary file, in which the data is saved periodically, in
case of a program crash before the data is explicitly saved.

00:42.180 --> 00:47.587
Once a file is opened, the full path to the video and data file currently open is shown in the title bar.

00:51.820 --> 00:54.192
To save all unsaved data, to the h 5 file

00:54.900 --> 00:56.086
press the save button

00:56.780 --> 00:58.944
or, hit the control s keyboard key.

00:59.660 --> 01:06.563
To check whether data is unsaved.
The presence of an asterisk in the title bar indicates that some of the data is currently unsaved.

01:07.259 --> 01:11.050
Additionally, a prompt is shown before closing, if data is unsaved.

01:15.259 --> 01:18.751
Glitter supports additional data operations through the drop-down menu.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.582
It supports saving normally,

01:21.300 --> 01:26.787
as well as saving any changes to a new h 5 file, leaving the currently open data file unchanged.

01:27.500 --> 01:33.096
It can open a video and data file in read only mode. Such that no changes can be saved to that file.

01:33.780 --> 01:37.334
It can remove any unsaved changes and reset to the last saved state

01:38.020 --> 01:40.434
or close the currently open file altogether.

01:41.140 --> 01:46.906
It can import all the channels metadata from an existing data file, without also importing the coded channel data.

01:47.620 --> 01:51.470
To facilitate sharing a template with all the channels, without the channel data.

01:51.670 --> 01:56.180
The channels metadata can be exported to a special yaml file and shared with others.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.713
Others can then import these channels from the yaml file.

02:00.420 --> 02:07.533
As a convenience, the most recent yaml template imported is listed in the menu.
And it can be imported again without having to browse for it.
