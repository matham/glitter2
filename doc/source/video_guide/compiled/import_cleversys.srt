00:00:00,100  --> 00:00:05,646
Glitter supports importing t x t files that contain coded data exported by the Clever System program.

2
00:00:05,846  --> 00:00:08,580
Demo t x t files can be found in the source code.

3
00:00:09,299  --> 00:00:10,935
From within the import section.

4
00:00:11,135  --> 00:00:14,836
First, select the Clever System importing mode from the drop down menu.

5
00:00:15,540  --> 00:00:22,304
Next, select the output directory, where the glitter h 5 data files that are generated
from the t x t files, will be created.

6
00:00:23,020  --> 00:00:27,110
Then, select the input directory containing the t x t files to process.

7
00:00:27,820  --> 00:00:36,150
This directory must also contain the video files used to generate the t x t files, because
the video files are needed by glitter to generate the h 5 files.

8
00:00:36,860  --> 00:00:42,047
Next, select the filter with which to select the t x t files in that directory and sub-directories.

9
00:00:42,247  --> 00:00:46,078
The shown filter will only select files that end with the t x t extension.

10
00:00:46,780  --> 00:00:48,385
Finally, click refresh.

11
00:00:49,100  --> 00:00:54,427
Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.

12
00:00:54,627  --> 00:01:05,023
Only the t c r files should be selected, because they contain the data. However, the t c g files
should also be in that directory, if they exist, because they will then be used to import the zones.
