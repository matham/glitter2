Glitter supports importing t x t files that contain coded data exported by the Clever System program.

00:05.846 --> 00:08.580
Demo t x t files can be found in the source code.

00:09.299 --> 00:10.935
From within the import section.

00:11.135 --> 00:14.836
First, select the Clever System importing mode from the drop down menu.

00:15.540 --> 00:22.304
Next, select the output directory, where the glitter h 5 data files that are generated
from the t x t files, will be created.

00:23.020 --> 00:27.110
Then, select the input directory containing the t x t files to process.

00:27.820 --> 00:36.150
This directory must also contain the video files used to generate the t x t files, because
the video files are needed by glitter to generate the h 5 files.

00:36.860 --> 00:42.047
Next, select the filter with which to select the t x t files in that directory and sub-directories.

00:42.247 --> 00:46.078
The shown filter will only select files that end with the t x t extension.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.385
Finally, click refresh.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.427
Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.

00:54.627 --> 01:05.023
Only the t c r files should be selected, because they contain the data. However, the t c g files
should also be in that directory, if they exist, because they will then be used to import the zones.
