1
00:00:00,100  --> 00:00:06,485
The calibration tool, allows calibrating the video size in pixels, to the real-world size
of the objects in the video.

2
00:00:06,685  --> 00:00:13,638
This, for example, allows computing the real world speed from video speed. By converting
pixel measurements to meter measurements.

3
00:00:14,340  --> 00:00:17,442
The pixels per meter metadata is exported with the raw data.

4
00:00:18,140  --> 00:00:20,963
To show the calibration tool, press the ruler button.

5
00:00:21,660  --> 00:00:25,351
This will show two points that can be adjusted to a known real world distance.

6
00:00:26,060  --> 00:00:29,172
For example, the corners are known to be eighteen inches apart.

7
00:00:29,860  --> 00:00:31,844
Then, press the calibration settings button,

8
00:00:32,540  --> 00:00:33,686
to show the settings.

9
00:00:34,380  --> 00:00:35,110
In the distance field,

10
00:00:35,820  --> 00:00:39,002
enter the real-world distance between the points, in millimeter.

11
00:00:39,700  --> 00:00:41,475
Finally, press the save button

12
00:00:42,180  --> 00:00:43,777
To compute, display, and save,

13
00:00:44,460  --> 00:00:46,664
the pixels per meter for the video file.
