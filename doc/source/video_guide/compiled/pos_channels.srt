00:00:02,100  --> 00:00:08,734
Position channels code the position of objects across video frames. For example, it could code the center
or nose of the animal.

2
00:00:08,934  --> 00:00:16,865
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the mean speed of the animal, or the mean distance to a point.

3
00:00:20,588  --> 00:00:26,783
Much of the channel management for position channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

4
00:00:30,955  --> 00:00:33,179
To code a channel, first select the channel.

5
00:00:33,855  --> 00:00:36,019
Now the channel can be coded with the mouse.

6
00:00:36,722  --> 00:00:41,760
A position channel can also be selected with an assigned keyboard key, such as n in this example.

7
00:00:42,422  --> 00:00:50,283
Once selected, while the video is playing, follow the position of the object with the mouse pressed down. This
will code the position for the current video frames.

8
00:01:27,489  --> 00:01:31,309
The recent position history of the tracked object can be shown, if enabled.

9
00:01:31,989  --> 00:01:34,991
Press the history button to show or hide the position history.

10
00:01:41,689  --> 00:01:45,020
Normally, the player will continuously show new frames to code.

11
00:01:45,723  --> 00:01:47,737
However, by setting the frame rate to the minimum,

12
00:01:48,423  --> 00:01:53,989
the player shows a single frame, and only advances to the next frame, when the mouse is pressed to code the frame.

13
00:01:54,189  --> 00:01:55,975
This allows more accurate coding.
