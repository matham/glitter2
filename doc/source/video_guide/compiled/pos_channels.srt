00:00:02,100  --> 00:00:08,734
Position channels code the position of objects across video frames. For example, it could code the center
or nose of the animal.

2
00:00:08,934  --> 00:00:16,865
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the mean speed of the animal, or the mean distance to a point.

3
00:00:20,634  --> 00:00:26,829
Much of the channel management for position channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

4
00:00:31,001  --> 00:00:33,225
To code a channel, first select the channel.

5
00:00:33,901  --> 00:00:36,065
Now the channel can be coded with the mouse.

6
00:00:36,768  --> 00:00:41,806
A position channel can also be selected with an assigned keyboard key, such as n in this example.

7
00:00:42,468  --> 00:00:50,479
Once selected, while the video is playing, follow the position of the nose with the mouse pressed down. This
will code the nose position for the current video frames.

8
00:00:57,468  --> 00:01:00,730
Select the center channel to then code the position of the mouse center.

9
00:01:12,502  --> 00:01:16,322
The recent position history of the tracked object can be shown, if enabled.

10
00:01:17,002  --> 00:01:20,004
Press the history button to show or hide the position history.

11
00:01:26,702  --> 00:01:30,033
Normally, the player will continuously show new frames to code.

12
00:01:30,736  --> 00:01:32,750
However, by setting the frame rate to the minimum,

13
00:01:33,436  --> 00:01:39,002
the player shows a single frame, and only advances to the next frame, when the mouse is pressed to code the frame.

14
00:01:39,202  --> 00:01:40,988
This allows more accurate coding.
