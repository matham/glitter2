00:00.100 --> 00:09.418
Event channels help code the occurrence of events, during video frames. For example, it could code when the animal is
sniffing at the left nose port, or that the animal is currently rearing.

00:09.618 --> 00:18.258
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the total duration the animal was sniffing, or the number of rearing events.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.918
To add an event channel,

00:26.600 --> 00:27.776
click on the event plus button,

00:28.467 --> 00:30.102
and a new channel will be created.

00:30.767 --> 00:31.959
To configure the event channel

00:32.634 --> 00:33.518
press the settings button,

00:34.234 --> 00:36.368
this will open the configuration window.

00:37.068 --> 00:39.781
To change the name, replace it with a new unique name.

00:41.968 --> 00:44.352
Delete the channel, by pressing the trash button.

00:48.535 --> 00:55.289
While the video is playing, to code that an event is currently occurring, press the channel button or
press the keyboard key configured for the channel.

01:10.035 --> 01:14.484
A unique keyboard key can be assigned to each channel. For example, the letter s.

01:15.202 --> 01:20.349
That key can then be used to code the channel, instead of
pressing the channel button manually, with the mouse.

01:21.036 --> 01:23.849
The keyboard key can be used to code in one of two modes.

01:24.536 --> 01:34.532
In the first, the channel will be coded as active while the key is held down. In the second, pressing the key
down once, will mark all subsequent frames as active, until the key is pressed again.

01:35.203 --> 01:39.682
The coded preview highlights the video frames that have been coded as active, for each channel.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.800
If a mistake was made, channel data can be erased in one of three ways.

01:48.504 --> 01:52.294
In the first, press the erase button while playing over the frames to be cleared.

01:54.971 --> 01:56.916
Notice the erase button being pressed!

02:07.238 --> 02:08.759
The second, is to select the channel

02:12.472 --> 02:15.454
and press the keyboard delete key while playing over the frames.

02:17.906 --> 02:21.146
Finally, you can clear the whole channel, by pressing the clear data button

02:21.873 --> 02:23.688
and all the channel data is cleared.

02:27.873 --> 02:33.739
Sometimes, it may be desired, to exclusively code only one channel from a group of channels as active, for any frame.

02:33.939 --> 02:34.470
To achieve this,

02:35.140 --> 02:40.387
set the group to the same value for every channel in the group. For example, add sniff to all channels.

02:44.107 --> 02:49.434
Then, when the non-sniffing channel is coded, the sniffing channel is automatically
cleared at that timestamp.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.856
To duplicate a channel and all its data,

02:57.574 --> 02:58.933
click on the duplicate channel button,

02:59.608 --> 03:02.131
and the channel will be duplicated, identically.
