Glitter supports computing statistics from the glitter coded data. It can compute
for example, the number of events of an event channel or the mean speed of a
position channel. The summery data can then be batch exported to an excel file.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.044
Here's an example summary excel file.

00:18.740 --> 00:22.471
From the main page, click export view, to switch to the export page.

00:23.180 --> 00:25.947
Once in the export view page, you can generate the summaries

00:26.660 --> 00:29.004
by selecting that mode from the dropdown menu.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.470
Following are the overall steps to export the data, with some of them optional.

00:39.700 --> 00:46.743
All files in the batch to be processed, must contain similar data channels. Otherwise,
they must be exported in separate batches.

00:47.460 --> 00:57.965
Any one file from the batch, must initially be selected as a template. This template file
will be used to create summary measures using the channel names in the file and then applied
to all the files in the batch.

00:58.165 --> 00:59.462
Select this file here.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.161
Also select the excel file where all the data will be exported to.

01:08.380 --> 01:12.140
Many measures accept parameters, such as a threshold or a start time.

01:12.340 --> 01:17.109
Some of these parameters can be given global default values shared across all measures
that use them.

01:17.820 --> 01:22.648
This section lists all these optional parameters as well as an explanation for each parameter.

01:23.339 --> 01:30.253
For example, the end parameter can be set to 2. Then, only the first two seconds of the
video will be used in the data summaries.

01:30.939 --> 01:35.988
Other parameters are specific to individual measures and cannot be given global default values.

01:36.699 --> 01:39.952
This section lists all these parameters and an explanation for them.

01:43.179 --> 01:47.639
Some measures require intermediate data channels, in addition to the user-coded channels.

01:47.839 --> 01:59.133
For example, to compute the total time the animal's nose was in a zone. We can create an intermediate
event channel from the nose position channel and the zone channel. This channel would be active whenever
the nose is in the zone.

01:59.333 --> 02:04.620
Then, for example, we can compute with the intermediate channel, the number of
times the nose entered the zone.

02:05.339 --> 02:08.023
This section lets you create these intermediate channels.

02:08.739 --> 02:14.925
To add a measure channel. First select the type of channel from which it will be created.
For example, a position channel.

02:15.619 --> 02:17.335
Then select the measure to create

02:18.019 --> 02:21.741
For example, the position channel is in a zone measure, mentioned above.

02:22.459 --> 02:24.285
And click the plus button to create it.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.374
Now, we will need to configure the channel.

02:28.060 --> 02:31.571
From the populated list of position channel names in the template file.

02:32.260 --> 02:35.152
Select a channel. For example the spiral channel.

02:35.859 --> 02:37.418
Then, expand the channel options,

02:38.100 --> 02:39.821
to show the documentation for the channel,

02:41.540 --> 02:44.103
as well as to configure any channel parameters.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.734
For example, from the list of zone channels

02:47.420 --> 02:49.185
select and add the circle channel.

02:49.899 --> 02:55.766
The intermediate channel will now create an event channel that is active,
whenever the spiral channel is within the circle zone.

02:56.459 --> 02:59.273
Finally, give the new intermediate channel a unique name.

03:02.500 --> 03:07.089
Glitter supports computing and exporting many common summary measures for all channel types.

03:07.289 --> 03:15.899
For example, we can export the mean speed of a position channel, the number of active periods
and total active duration of an event channel, or the total area of a zone channel.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.043
This section lets you create these summary measures.

03:19.740 --> 03:24.329
To add a measure. Select the type of channel to which it will be applied and the specific measure.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.845
And click the plus button to create it.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.119
This measure will compute the total duration that the specified event channel was coded as active.

03:32.820 --> 03:36.250
Next, we need to select the channels for which we will compute this in the report.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.902
It will be computed for both the spiral and event channels.

03:40.620 --> 03:45.059
You can also optionally add an ID to the measure that will be included with the measure in the report.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.850
Finally, you can further configure the measure or read the measure documentation.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.894
Next, we will select and add another measure.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.869
This measure computes the mean distance between a position channel and the center of a zone.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.498
From the pre-populated position channel list,

04:03.180 --> 04:05.614
we will compute this measure for the spiral channel.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.273
For the zone channel parameter, from the data file's list of zones,

04:09.980 --> 04:11.645
we will select the circle zone.

04:11.845 --> 04:16.883
Therefore, this measure will compute the mean distance between the
spiral channel and the center of the circle.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.600
You can further read the measure documentation, or set the optional parameters.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.341
Once we configured the measures, we can select the files in the batch.

04:30.541 --> 04:34.083
First, select the input directory with the data files to process.

04:34.780 --> 04:39.568
Then, select a filter with which to select the data files in that directory and sub-directories.

04:39.768 --> 04:45.535
The shown filter will only select files that end with the h 5 extension, which is the extension of the data files.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.825
Finally, click refresh.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.612
Glitter will now list all the matched files that are to be processed.

04:52.300 --> 04:57.138
To start the export process, press the play button to start exporting data from the files.

04:57.820 --> 05:01.331
Then, the exported data will be found in the configured excel file.
