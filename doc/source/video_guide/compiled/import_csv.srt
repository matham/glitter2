00:00:00,100  --> 00:00:05,178
Glitter supports importing c s v files that contain coded data exported by other programs.

2
00:00:05,378  --> 00:00:08,121
Demo c s v files can be found in the source code.

3
00:00:08,820  --> 00:00:10,455
From within the import section.

4
00:00:10,655  --> 00:00:14,207
First, select the c s v importing mode from the drop down menu.

5
00:00:14,900  --> 00:00:21,494
Then, select the output directory, where the glitter h 5 data files that are generated
from the c s v files, will be created.

6
00:00:22,180  --> 00:00:26,380
Next, select the input directory containing the c s v files to process.

7
00:00:27,100  --> 00:00:37,695
This directory should optionally contain the video files that was used to generate the c s v files.
Glitter needs these video files if the input c s v files do not contain data for all video frames.

8
00:00:38,380  --> 00:00:43,428
Then, select a filter with which to select the c s v files in that directory and sub-directories.

9
00:00:43,628  --> 00:00:47,428
The shown filter will only select files that end with the c s v extension.

10
00:00:48,140  --> 00:00:49,745
Finally, click refresh.

11
00:00:50,460  --> 00:00:55,787
Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.
