00:00:00,100  --> 00:00:12,142
Glitter supports computing statistics from the glitter coded data. It can compute
for example, the number of events of an event channel or the mean speed of a
position channel. The summery data can then be batch exported to an excel file.

2
00:00:12,860  --> 00:00:15,044
Here's an example summary excel file.

3
00:00:18,740  --> 00:00:22,471
From the main page, click export view, to switch to the export page.

4
00:00:23,180  --> 00:00:25,947
Once in the export view page, you can generate the summaries

5
00:00:26,660  --> 00:00:29,004
by selecting that mode from the dropdown menu.

6
00:00:29,700  --> 00:00:33,470
Following are the overall steps to export the data, with some of them optional.

7
00:00:39,700  --> 00:00:46,743
All files in the batch to be processed, must contain similar data channels. Otherwise,
they must be exported in separate batches.

8
00:00:47,460  --> 00:00:57,965
Any one file from the batch, must initially be selected as a template. This template file
will be used to create summary measures using the channel names in the file and then applied
to all the files in the batch.

9
00:00:58,165  --> 00:00:59,462
Select this file here.

10
00:01:01,700  --> 00:01:05,161
Also select the excel file where all the data will be exported to.

11
00:01:08,380  --> 00:01:12,140
Many measures accept parameters, such as a threshold or a start time.

12
00:01:12,340  --> 00:01:17,109
Some of these parameters can be given global default values shared across all measures
that use them.

13
00:01:17,820  --> 00:01:22,648
This section lists all these optional parameters as well as an explanation for each parameter.

14
00:01:23,339  --> 00:01:30,253
For example, the end parameter can be set to 2. Then, only the first two seconds of the
video will be used in the data summaries.

15
00:01:30,939  --> 00:01:35,988
Other parameters are specific to individual measures and cannot be given global default values.

16
00:01:36,699  --> 00:01:39,952
This section lists all these parameters and an explanation for them.

17
00:01:43,179  --> 00:01:47,639
Some measures require intermediate data channels, in addition to the user-coded channels.

18
00:01:47,839  --> 00:01:59,133
For example, to compute the total time the animal's nose was in a zone. We can create an intermediate
event channel from the nose position channel and the zone channel. This channel would be active whenever
the nose is in the zone.

19
00:01:59,333  --> 00:02:04,620
Then, for example, we can compute with the intermediate channel, the number of
times the nose entered the zone.

20
00:02:05,339  --> 00:02:08,023
This section lets you create these intermediate channels.

21
00:02:08,739  --> 00:02:14,925
To add a measure channel. First select the type of channel from which it will be created.
For example, a position channel.

22
00:02:15,619  --> 00:02:17,335
Then select the measure to create

23
00:02:18,019  --> 00:02:21,741
For example, the position channel is in a zone measure, mentioned above.

24
00:02:22,459  --> 00:02:24,285
And click the plus button to create it.

25
00:02:24,980  --> 00:02:27,374
Now, we will need to configure the channel.

26
00:02:28,060  --> 00:02:31,571
From the populated list of position channel names in the template file.

27
00:02:32,260  --> 00:02:35,152
Select a channel. For example the spiral channel.

28
00:02:35,859  --> 00:02:37,418
Then, expand the channel options,

29
00:02:38,100  --> 00:02:39,821
to show the documentation for the channel,

30
00:02:41,540  --> 00:02:44,103
as well as to configure any channel parameters.

31
00:02:44,820  --> 00:02:46,734
For example, from the list of zone channels

32
00:02:47,420  --> 00:02:49,185
select and add the circle channel.

33
00:02:49,899  --> 00:02:55,766
The intermediate channel will now create an event channel that is active,
whenever the spiral channel is within the circle zone.

34
00:02:56,459  --> 00:02:59,273
Finally, give the new intermediate channel a unique name.

35
00:03:02,500  --> 00:03:07,089
Glitter supports computing and exporting many common summary measures for all channel types.

36
00:03:07,289  --> 00:03:15,899
For example, we can export the mean speed of a position channel, the number of active periods
and total active duration of an event channel, or the total area of a zone channel.

37
00:03:16,580  --> 00:03:19,043
This section lets you create these summary measures.

38
00:03:19,740  --> 00:03:24,329
To add a measure. Select the type of channel to which it will be applied and the specific measure.

39
00:03:25,020  --> 00:03:26,845
And click the plus button to create it.

40
00:03:27,540  --> 00:03:32,119
This measure will compute the total duration that the specified event channel was coded as active.

41
00:03:32,820  --> 00:03:36,250
Next, we need to select the channels for which we will compute this in the report.

42
00:03:36,940  --> 00:03:39,902
It will be computed for both the spiral and event channels.

43
00:03:40,620  --> 00:03:45,059
You can also optionally add an ID to the measure that will be included with the measure in the report.

44
00:03:45,740  --> 00:03:49,850
Finally, you can further configure the measure or read the measure documentation.

45
00:03:52,540  --> 00:03:54,894
Next, we will select and add another measure.

46
00:03:55,580  --> 00:03:59,869
This measure computes the mean distance between a position channel and the center of a zone.

47
00:04:00,580  --> 00:04:02,498
From the pre-populated position channel list,

48
00:04:03,180  --> 00:04:05,614
we will compute this measure for the spiral channel.

49
00:04:06,300  --> 00:04:09,273
For the zone channel parameter, from the data file's list of zones,

50
00:04:09,980  --> 00:04:11,645
we will select the circle zone.

51
00:04:11,845  --> 00:04:16,883
Therefore, this measure will compute the mean distance between the
spiral channel and the center of the circle.

52
00:04:17,580  --> 00:04:21,600
You can further read the measure documentation, or set the optional parameters.

53
00:04:26,820  --> 00:04:30,341
Once we configured the measures, we can select the files in the batch.

54
00:04:30,541  --> 00:04:34,083
First, select the input directory with the data files to process.

55
00:04:34,780  --> 00:04:39,568
Then, select a filter with which to select the data files in that directory and sub-directories.

56
00:04:39,768  --> 00:04:45,535
The shown filter will only select files that end with the h 5 extension, which is the extension of the data files.

57
00:04:46,220  --> 00:04:47,825
Finally, click refresh.

58
00:04:48,540  --> 00:04:51,612
Glitter will now list all the matched files that are to be processed.

59
00:04:52,300  --> 00:04:57,138
To start the export process, press the play button to start exporting data from the files.

60
00:04:57,820  --> 00:05:01,331
Then, the exported data will be found in the configured excel file.
