00:00.100 --> 00:06.485
The calibration tool, allows calibrating the video size in pixels, to the real-world size
of the objects in the video.

00:06.685 --> 00:13.638
This, for example, allows computing the real world speed from video speed. By converting
pixel measurements to meter measurements.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.442
The pixels per meter metadata is exported with the raw data.

00:18.140 --> 00:20.963
To show the calibration tool, press the ruler button.

00:21.660 --> 00:25.351
This will show two points that can be adjusted to a known real world distance.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.172
For example, the corners are known to be eighteen inches apart.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.844
Then, press the calibration settings button,

00:32.540 --> 00:33.686
to show the settings.

00:34.380 --> 00:35.110
In the distance field,

00:35.820 --> 00:39.002
enter the real-world distance between the points, in millimeter.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.475
Finally, press the save button

00:42.180 --> 00:43.777
To compute, display, and save,

00:44.460 --> 00:46.664
the pixels per meter for the video file.
