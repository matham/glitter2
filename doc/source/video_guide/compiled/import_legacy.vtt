Glitter supports importing legacy glitter files. These are files created by much
older versions of glitter that cannot be opened directly by the current version of glitter.

00:09.219 --> 00:10.855
From within the import section.

00:11.055 --> 00:14.467
First, select the legacy importing mode from the drop down menu.

00:15.179 --> 00:21.694
Then, select the output directory, where the glitter h 5 data files that are generated
from the legacy files, will be created.

00:22.380 --> 00:26.440
Next, select the input directory containing the legacy files to process.

00:27.140 --> 00:32.078
then, select the filter with which to select the legacy files in that directory and sub-directories.

00:32.278 --> 00:36.029
The shown filter will only select files that end with the h 5 extension.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.345
Finally, click refresh.

00:39.060 --> 00:44.387
Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.
