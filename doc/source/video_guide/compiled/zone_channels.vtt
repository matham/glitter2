Zone channels code the position of static objects in the video. For example, it could code the position of
odors to be sniffed.

00:08.764 --> 00:17.584
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the area of the zone, or the duration the animal was in the zone, if coded.

00:21.306 --> 00:27.311
Much of the channel management for zone channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

00:27.511 --> 00:31.272
However, unlike event channels, zone channels are added by drawing them.

00:35.473 --> 00:37.766
To draw a zone, first enable showing the zones,

00:38.473 --> 00:40.368
then, enable editing the zones.

00:41.073 --> 00:45.921
The type of zone created, is controlled by the zone mode selected. The default is freeform.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.907
To draw a freeform polygon,

00:48.607 --> 00:50.831
drag the mouse over the area to enclose.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.782
To draw a more precise polygon,

00:58.474 --> 01:03.731
place polygon vertices by pressing the mouse on each point. To finish, double click the mouse.

01:03.931 --> 01:11.354
The zone can be edited by slow-pressing a vertex and dragging it. The overall zone can be dragged,
when not editing it, by dragging the first point.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.281
To draw an ellipse,

01:27.975 --> 01:32.703
drop the ellipse center with the mouse. Then, edit it, by dragging the points on the radius.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.148
To draw a circle,

01:42.842 --> 01:47.690
drop the circle center with the mouse. Then, edit it, by dragging the point on the radius.

02:01.609 --> 02:02.561
To place a single point,

02:03.243 --> 02:06.894
drop the point with the mouse. It can be edited, by dragging the point.

02:21.510 --> 02:24.802
The zones can be hidden or shown, by toggling the display button.

02:25.510 --> 02:26.487
To either show them.

02:27.177 --> 02:27.954
Or hide them
