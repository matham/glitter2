00:02.100 --> 00:08.734
Position channels code the position of objects across video frames. For example, it could code the center
or nose of the animal.

00:08.934 --> 00:16.865
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the mean speed of the animal, or the mean distance to a point.

00:20.634 --> 00:26.829
Much of the channel management for position channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

00:31.001 --> 00:33.225
To code a channel, first select the channel.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.065
Now the channel can be coded with the mouse.

00:36.768 --> 00:41.806
A position channel can also be selected with an assigned keyboard key, such as n in this example.

00:42.468 --> 00:50.479
Once selected, while the video is playing, follow the position of the nose with the mouse pressed down. This
will code the nose position for the current video frames.

00:57.468 --> 01:00.730
Select the center channel to then code the position of the mouse center.

01:12.502 --> 01:16.322
The recent position history of the tracked object can be shown, if enabled.

01:17.002 --> 01:20.004
Press the history button to show or hide the position history.

01:26.702 --> 01:30.033
Normally, the player will continuously show new frames to code.

01:30.736 --> 01:32.750
However, by setting the frame rate to the minimum,

01:33.436 --> 01:39.002
the player shows a single frame, and only advances to the next frame, when the mouse is pressed to code the frame.

01:39.202 --> 01:40.988
This allows more accurate coding.
