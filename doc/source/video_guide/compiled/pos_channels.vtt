Position channels code the position of objects across video frames. For example, it could code the center
or nose of the animal.

00:08.934 --> 00:16.865
The coded data can later be exported as raw data or summarized. For example, it can export
the mean speed of the animal, or the mean distance to a point.

00:20.588 --> 00:26.783
Much of the channel management for position channels, is the same as for event channels.
Please see the event channel guide.

00:30.955 --> 00:33.179
To code a channel, first select the channel.

00:33.855 --> 00:36.019
Now the channel can be coded with the mouse.

00:36.722 --> 00:41.760
A position channel can also be selected with an assigned keyboard key, such as n in this example.

00:42.422 --> 00:50.283
Once selected, while the video is playing, follow the position of the object with the mouse pressed down. This
will code the position for the current video frames.

01:27.489 --> 01:31.309
The recent position history of the tracked object can be shown, if enabled.

01:31.989 --> 01:34.991
Press the history button to show or hide the position history.

01:41.689 --> 01:45.020
Normally, the player will continuously show new frames to code.

01:45.723 --> 01:47.737
However, by setting the frame rate to the minimum,

01:48.423 --> 01:53.989
the player shows a single frame, and only advances to the next frame, when the mouse is pressed to code the frame.

01:54.189 --> 01:55.975
This allows more accurate coding.
