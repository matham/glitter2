00:00:00,100  --> 00:00:04,599
Glitter lets you code behaviors, and lets you track the position of objects in a video file.

2
00:00:05,300  --> 00:00:07,901
To begin, browse for a video file with the browse button.

3
00:00:08,620  --> 00:00:10,136
and select a video file.

4
00:00:10,819  --> 00:00:12,894
This will open the video file in glitter.

5
00:00:17,100  --> 00:00:22,607
When data is coded with glitter, it stores the coded data, in a h 5 file right next to the video file.

6
00:00:23,300  --> 00:00:29,076
If the data file already exists, glitter will open the data file. Otherwise it will create a new data file.

7
00:00:29,276  --> 00:00:33,047
This data file is later used when computing and exporting statistics.

8
00:00:33,740  --> 00:00:41,491
Glitter also creates a temporary file, in which the data is saved periodically, in
case of a program crash before the data is explicitly saved.

9
00:00:42,180  --> 00:00:47,587
Once a file is opened, the full path to the video and data file currently open is shown in the title bar.

10
00:00:51,820  --> 00:00:54,192
To save all unsaved data, to the h 5 file

11
00:00:54,900  --> 00:00:56,086
press the save button

12
00:00:56,780  --> 00:00:58,944
or, hit the control s keyboard key.

13
00:00:59,660  --> 00:01:06,563
To check whether data is unsaved.
The presence of an asterisk in the title bar indicates that some of the data is currently unsaved.

14
00:01:07,259  --> 00:01:11,050
Additionally, a prompt is shown before closing, if data is unsaved.

15
00:01:15,259  --> 00:01:18,751
Glitter supports additional data operations through the drop-down menu.

16
00:01:19,460  --> 00:01:20,582
It supports saving normally,

17
00:01:21,300  --> 00:01:26,787
as well as saving any changes to a new h 5 file, leaving the currently open data file unchanged.

18
00:01:27,500  --> 00:01:33,096
It can open a video and data file in read only mode. Such that no changes can be saved to that file.

19
00:01:33,780  --> 00:01:37,334
It can remove any unsaved changes and reset to the last saved state

20
00:01:38,020  --> 00:01:40,434
or close the currently open file altogether.

21
00:01:41,140  --> 00:01:46,906
It can import all the channels metadata from an existing data file, without also importing the coded channel data.

22
00:01:47,620  --> 00:01:51,470
To facilitate sharing a template with all the channels, without the channel data.

23
00:01:51,670  --> 00:01:56,180
The channels metadata can be exported to a special yaml file and shared with others.

24
00:01:56,900  --> 00:01:59,713
Others can then import these channels from the yaml file.

25
00:02:00,420  --> 00:02:07,533
As a convenience, the most recent yaml template imported is listed in the menu.
And it can be imported again without having to browse for it.
