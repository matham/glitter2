This directory must also contain the video files used to generate the t x t files, because
the video files are needed by glitter to generate the h 5 files.

Next, select the filter with which to select the t x t files in that directory and sub-directories.

The shown filter will only select files that end with the t x t extension.

Glitter will now list all the matched files and they are ready to be processed as described in the
main import guide.

Only the t c r files should be selected, because they contain the data. However, the t c g files
should also be in that directory, if they exist, because they will then be used to import the zones.
